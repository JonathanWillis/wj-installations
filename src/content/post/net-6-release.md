At Software Minions, we constantly seek out technologies that empower us to deliver exceptional solutions for our clients. With the release of **.NET 6** on November 8, 2021, we’re excited to integrate this Long-Term Support (LTS) version into our development workflows. As the culmination of Microsoft’s journey to unify the .NET ecosystem, .NET 6 brings enhanced performance, productivity, and scalability to all our projects.

## Why We’re Adopting .NET 6  

### Unified and Mature Ecosystem  
.NET 6 fully realizes the vision of a unified development platform, supporting applications across desktop, web, cloud, mobile, IoT, and AI workloads. This consistency allows us to streamline our tools and practices, making development faster and maintenance more efficient for our clients.

### Unparalleled Performance  
Performance is non-negotiable in the modern software landscape, and .NET 6 delivers unmatched speed and efficiency. Its Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation improvements reduce application startup times and memory usage, ensuring top-tier performance, whether we’re building for the cloud or local devices.

### Simplified Development with Minimal APIs  
.NET 6 introduces **Minimal APIs**, which drastically reduce boilerplate code for web applications. This enables us to create lightweight services more quickly, keeping costs low while maintaining our high-quality standards.

### Blazor Hybrid Apps  
Blazor in .NET 6 extends its capabilities to support hybrid apps, allowing us to create desktop and mobile applications using web technologies. This new capability broadens our ability to deliver seamless user experiences across platforms.

### C# 10 and Productivity Gains  
With the latest version of C#, we’re seeing features like global `using` directives, file-scoped namespaces, and improved patterns. These enhancements simplify codebases and reduce developer friction, letting us focus on solving real-world problems for our clients.

### Hot Reload  
The addition of **Hot Reload** allows us to make changes to code and see the results immediately, without restarting the application. This accelerates development cycles, saving valuable time on iterative tasks.

## Our .NET 6 Strategy  

### New Projects Start Here  
Going forward, all new projects will be built on .NET 6 to take full advantage of its capabilities and LTS support, which extends through November 2024.  

### Modernizing Existing Solutions  
We’re identifying existing projects that would benefit from .NET 6’s performance gains and new features. By migrating these applications, we can offer clients enhanced performance and maintainability.  

### Upskilling Our Teams  
Our developers are already diving deep into .NET 6, mastering its new features and paradigms. This ensures we’re prepared to deliver top-quality solutions using the latest tools.  

### Educating Our Clients  
We’re proactively reaching out to clients to discuss the advantages of .NET 6, helping them make informed decisions about upgrading their applications or starting new projects with the platform.  

## What .NET 6 Means for You  

For our clients, the adoption of .NET 6 means faster, more efficient applications built with the latest technology. Whether it’s cloud-based enterprise systems, cross-platform mobile apps, or innovative IoT solutions, .NET 6 provides the foundation we need to deliver exceptional value.  

## Let’s Build the Future Together
